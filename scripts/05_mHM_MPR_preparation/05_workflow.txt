Workflow description for 05_mHM_MPR_preparation
Moritz Feigl, Aug 2020

This intial step includes compiling MPR and mHM and creates spatial predictors for FSO with MPR on the Vienna Scientific Cluster.
The whole procedure is implemented as a bash script: 05_mHM_MPR_preparation.sh
It includes following steps:
      1. Download mHM and MPR from gitlab
      2. Check if TFs are registered
      3. Compile mHM and MPR
      4. Create FSO spatial predictors with MPR

The bash script includes two paths: PROJECTPATH, MPR_PATH and MHM_PATH.
PROJECTPATH is the folder in which MPR, mHM and all FSO predictors should be saved
MPR_PATH is the path to the directory containing the MPR namelists: mpr_global_parameter_mhm.nml and mpr_predictor_FSO_only.nml
MHM_PATH is the path to the directory that contains the FSO_mHM_major_basins directory.

To start the script run: ./05_mHM_MPR_preparation.sh
